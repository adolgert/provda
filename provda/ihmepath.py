"""
These are rules about how to build IHME paths.

A path has:
1) A base disk location for all data. /ihme, or J:/ihme.
2) A team location, such as /forecasting.
3) A role for a dataset, such as sev_data, or sev_forecasts.
4) A date an description, as YYYMMDD_whatever.
5) Subdirectories for results.
