File Annotation
===============

These methods help add annotations to files to indicate
what wrote them. This adds key-value pairs to a PDF file.
It can be used after a plot is created.::

    import provda.pdf

    about = {"user": getpass.user(), "script": __file__}
    provda.pdf.add_keys(filename, about)

Similarly, HDF can do the same thing.::

    import provda.collect
    import provda.hdf

    running = provda.collect.this_process()
    made_it = provda.collect.create_file(file_path)
    message = provda.collect.flatten(running, made_it)
    provda.hdf.add_keys(filename, message)

The ``flatten()`` method takes all of the keys and values
and packs them into a list of attributes which are equivalent
to "the agent is this process, the artifact is that file, and
the file was generated by this process."
