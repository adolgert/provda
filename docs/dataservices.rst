We track input data so that we can know what field observations
contributed to the estimations and predictions we put in our
papers, graphs, presentations, and online on the GHDx.
IHME has a system for tracking input data collections that uses
node ids (NIDs).

Source of data can be papers, datasets, or collections of
datasets online. A source of data can be a collections that says
it got data from another source.
Each NID is associated with one input data source. The data from
one source will likely be assigned more than one NID. In some cases,
a paper's data will be split up by country, with each country's values
assigned a different NID.
All data in the GHDx must have an NID. This includes results
produced by IHME and some intermediate products, called
"modeled products."

How do we know what data sources produced a given graph?
Right now, someone gives a list of which sources went into
which products.

*Can we track NIDs in some way that is automated and as
informative as what we have now?*

For computation, an NID is associated with some set of
data. A file has data from at least one NID or derived
from at least one NID.
